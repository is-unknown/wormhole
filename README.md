- **Intercom in all buildings**: SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT A WORMHOLE IS HURLING TOWARD THE EARTH!
Meanwhile in some lab:
- **Peter**: But we do not have the technology to spacerocket out of earth with a 7 billion people..
- **Jon**: Then we will stop the wormhole.
- **Peter**: How?
*On the streets people are panicking*:
- **Ned**: WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Back to the lab:
- **Jon**: Wait, the wormhole is going the other way!
- **Peter**: WE'RE SAVED!
- **Intercom in all buildings**: The wormhole is going the opposite direction, we're all safe.
- **Ned**: WE'RE ALL GONNA LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we were actually the ones that moved the wormhole.
